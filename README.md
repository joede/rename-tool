# Rename-Tool

`rename-tool` is a commandline tool to rename files. It can change, lowercase
and uppercase a batch of files or modify their ownership. It's a small and
quick tool written in C so it's quicker than most rename tools written in shell
scripts. `rename-tool` is powered by the extended regular expression for
searching and substituting string patterns in the file names.

`rename-tool` is a fork of [renamex](http://rename.sourceforge.net) written by
*Andy Xuming* <xuming@users.sourceforge.net>. Since this project is dead since
several years now, I've decided to fork it to add some new features I want to
have.


## Features

* substitue strings in file's name
* search and substitue strings in file's name by regular expression
* uppercase or lowercase file's name
* support batch renaming
* recursively processing directories and subdirectories
* change ownership of files
* safe mode: test before you go


## Install

Download rename distribution then unpack it with `tar -zxf`:

    ~~~~
    make
    make install
    ~~~~


## BUGS reporting

Please report bugs at the [project page at github](http://github.com/joede/rename-tool/issues).


## Examples


* To lowercase all files' names recursively.

    ~~~~
    rename-tool -l -R *
    ~~~~

* Substitute all 'abc' substrings appeared in C sources files  with
  'xyz', ignoring the case, then uppercase the whole file name.

    ~~~~
    rename-tool -u -s/abc/xyz/gi *.c
    ~~~~

* Find all files with the '.c' suffix in the current directory and change
  them to '.cpp' suffix. Print the verbose information.

    ~~~~
    rename-tool -v -s/.c/.cpp/s *
    ~~~~

* Find all files with the '.c' suffix under the current directory and change
  them to '.cpp' suffix by the list file.

    ~~~~
    find . -name *.c > filename.lst
    rename-tool -s/.c/.cpp/s -f filename.lst
    ~~~~

* Read names from the 'filename.lst', find the last occurrence of 'abc'
  and  replace it with '12345', ignoring the case.

    ~~~~
    rename-tool -s/abc/12345/bi *
    ~~~~

* The target substring starts with a capital letter, and ends with string
  'file'. There are 0 or any numbers of characters between the capital letter
  and 'file'. The substring, if encountered in filenames, will be replaced
  with 'nofile'.

    ~~~~
    rename-tool -s/^[A-Z].*file/nofile/r *
    ~~~~

* Similar to above, except it uses extended regular expression, such as
  the '+' metacharacter, and replaces all matching strings with 'nofile'.

    ~~~~
    rename-tool -s/^[A-Z].+file/nofile/eg *
    ~~~~

* Test mode only. Simulate the rename process but no files would be
  actually changed.

    ~~~~
    rename-tool -t -s/^[A-Z].+file/nofile/eg *
    ~~~~

* change the ownership of `/home/custom` to 'guest'. The 'guest' should be
  an effective user in the current system. If `/home/custom` is a directory,
  all files' ownership in this directory tree will be changed to 'guest'.

    ~~~~
    rename-tool -o guest -R /home/custom
    ~~~~
